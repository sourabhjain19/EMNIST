### Extension of MNIST to handwritten letters
Open the python notebook file (with extension .ipynb) through Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Drive and then acces it through Google Collab.
<br>If open through Jupyter Notebook, do not run the first slide, directly run from the second slide.
<br>Set the paths of train, test and map datasets as of in your system.
<br>The notebook creates a new file with an extension of (.h5). Set the path accordingly while loading it back.
<br>For custom inputs, enter the path of the image and enter the number of handwritten characters which are present in the image. This gives the predicted class as output.
