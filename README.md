### Extension of MNIST to handwritten letters
1. Open the python notebook file (with extension .ipynb) through Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Drive and then acces it through Google Collab.
<br>2. If open through Jupyter Notebook, do not run the first slide, directly run from the second slide.
<br>3. Set the paths of train, test and map datasets as of in your system.
<br>4. The notebook creates a new file with an extension of (.h5). Set the path accordingly while loading it back.
<br>5. For custom inputs, enter the path of the image and enter the number of handwritten characters which are present in the image. This gives the predicted class as output.
